# A Smart Problem Solving Forum for DIU Engineering Students

I have built a MERN Stack-based web application called "Smart Problem-Solving Forum", a platform that allows users to share their notes and engage in discussions related to various academic topics. The platform is designed to provide a user-friendly interface that encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among users.

## Objectives

1. Users can create an account and upload their notes, which can be categorized by department tag, topic, and course.

2. Other users can search for and view these notes and leave comments and feedback to initiate discussions.

3. Additionally, users can create discussion threads on the forum to engage in more in-depth conversations about specific topics.

4. The platform also includes features such as a search function, filtering the best results based on topic, and user profiles to enhance the user experience.

## Motivation

This web application is designed to address the common challenges faced by students in university life, such as confusion in finding essential solutions and a lack of proper instruction. The Notes Sharing and Discussion Forum aims to provide a collaborative learning environment that fosters community and helps students succeed in their academic activities.

## Expected Outcome

✅ Students access authentic, reliable solutions to problems.

✅ The Platform offers students guidance and resources for academic success.

✅ Users will be able to obtain early solutions to their problems through the collaborative nature of the platform.

✅ A Web application enables alumni-student networking, mentorship, and knowledge sharing.
